#### Abstract
This Document presents the verification of RISCV-RV32I which is 32-bit processor core implemented using 5-stage pipelining. Five stage pipelining enables faster execution of instructions using pre-fetch and branching operation. It has ROM inside which stores the instructions which has to be executed sequentially in a pipeline architecture. This design is implemented using Verilog-2003 and simulated using Icarus-Verilog and GTK-Wave. This design will be verified using python based
verification methodology CoCoTb.

#### Verification Environment
The verification environment is setup using [Vyoma's UpTickPro](https://vyomasystems.com) provided for the hackathon.
